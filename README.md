#Opt-out
This project is a Google Chrome browser extension which allows the user to opt-out of Donald Trump on the internet.  

##About  
This project was not written due to political affiliation.  It was written more as a commentary on the media's coverage of Donald Trump.  At some points during the process of building this project, Donald Trump had over twenty articles about him on the front page of CNN.com.  This statistic seems like an exageration but it is not and CNN is not the only news organization trying to capitalize on Donald Trump's popularity.  Every news outlet has had between 3 and 30 articles on their front page regarding Donald Trump.  

I want to be able to view other news these websites provide without having to navigate around so much content pertaining to one subject.  

##Technologies Used  
This project was written in basic Javascript in an effort to make the script run as efficiently as possible as it will be running on every page load.
